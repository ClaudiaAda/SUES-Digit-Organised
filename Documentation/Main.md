# Main 

In this file the visualisation of the Sanky diagram and the graphical interface of the web page is done. It is the main file from which other files and functions are called. 
Dash and Plotly libraries are used for building a analytical web application with an interactive dashboard in Python.

## Layout Settings

The web page is divided in sections using `dbc.Col()` and `dbc.Row`. In this way a grid system for dividing the screen is created. The grid system divides the screen into 12 columns that can be adjusted (`'weight': '100vw'`). Inside those subsections, there are components split by divisions by using `html.Div`.
