Read me Peak Hour datasets:

These are in the Units MWh for the peak hour in winter!! 
The peak hour represents the average consumption during that wors hour, hence is still in MWh.

Moreover, the constant variable files can be used, even if they are in GWh, but need to be transformed from GWh to MWh accurately.
